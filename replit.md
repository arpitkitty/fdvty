# AICoach

## Overview

AICoach appears to be a new project in its initial stages, with only a basic README file present. The project name suggests it's likely an AI-powered coaching or mentoring application, but the specific functionality and architecture are yet to be implemented.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

Currently, no system architecture has been established as the project is in its initial state. The following architectural decisions will need to be made as development progresses:

1. **Frontend Framework** - Choice between React, Vue, Angular, or other modern frameworks
2. **Backend Technology** - Selection of server-side technology (Node.js, Python, etc.)
3. **Database Solution** - Decision on data storage approach (SQL vs NoSQL)
4. **AI Integration** - Implementation of AI/ML capabilities for coaching functionality
5. **Authentication System** - User management and security implementation
6. **Deployment Strategy** - Hosting and deployment architecture

## External Dependencies

No external dependencies have been identified at this stage. Potential future integrations may include:

1. **AI/ML Services** - OpenAI, Anthropic, or other AI providers for coaching capabilities
2. **Database Services** - Cloud database solutions
3. **Authentication Providers** - Third-party auth services
4. **Hosting Platforms** - Cloud deployment services
